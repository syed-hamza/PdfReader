Traditional attention mechanisms can be memory intensive because they require storing large attention matrices, which can be prohibitive especially for long sequences. FlashAttention tackles this by performing attention computation in a more memory-efficient manner, often leveraging techniques such as tiling and recomputation to minimize memory footprint without sacrificing performance."}, {"sender": "user", "text": "show me the paper."}, {"sender": "bot", "text": "I cannot provide the full text of the paper directly.
