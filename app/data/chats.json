The study aims to identify optimal RAG practices and investigate the effectiveness of existing approaches. \n\n<b>Key Findings:</b>\n\n* The integration of multimodal retrieval techniques can substantially improve question-answering capabilities on visual inputs.\n* A strategy of \"retrieval as generation\" can speed up the generation of multimodal content.\n\n<b>Evaluation Metrics and Datasets:</b>\n\nThe study uses a combination of general, specialized (or domain-specific), and RAG-related evaluation metrics to assess the performance of RAG models. The datasets used include MSMARCO Embedding Model, BAAI/LLM-Embedder, BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5, thenlper/gte-base, thenlper/gte-small, jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en, intfloat/e5-small-v2, and sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2.\n\n<b>Conclusion:</b>\n\nThe study demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG models in improving question-answering capabilities and generating multimodal content. The results provide valuable insights for deploying RAG models in different application scenarios, balancing performance and efficiency.\n\n\nFurther research is required to explore other potential combinations of RAG approaches and their applications in various domains."}]}]
