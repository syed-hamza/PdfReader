The memory requirement is O(N), which includes the input matrices, output matrix, and logsumexp matrix.\n\n<b>Causal Masking Speedup</b>\n\nWhen causal masking is applied, the algorithm achieves a speedup of around 1.7-1.8x compared to attention without the causal mask. This is because approximately half of the blocks can be skipped during computation.\n\n<b>Correctness and Accuracy</b>\n\nThe FlashAttention-2 algorithm returns the correct output O = softmax(QK^T)V with no approximation, using O(N^2 \\* d) FLOPs and requiring O(N) additional memory beyond inputs and output. The proof of correctness is similar to that of Dao et al. [5, Theorem 1]."}]}]
