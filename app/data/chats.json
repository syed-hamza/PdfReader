The new version of the attention mechanism demonstrates better parallelism and work partitioning which leads to significant speed enhancements in training models with longer contexts using GPU resources. \n\nThe team behind this development included Phil Tillet, Daniel Haziza, Driss Guessous, the Nvidia CUTLASS team (including Vijay Thakkar, Cris Cecka, Haicheng Wu, and Andrew Kerr), as well as Stanford CRFM and Stanford NLP.\n\nFLASHATTENSION-2 achieves around 2x speedup compared to the original FlashAttention, allowing for training models with contexts twice as long (16k versus 8k) using similar resources. This is particularly useful in processing high-resolution images or understanding longer texts and reports.\n\nThe team has plans to optimize FLASHATTENTION-2 further by making it applicable on different GPU types like H100 and AMD GPUs, as well as new data types such as FP8. They also plan to combine this low-level optimization with high-level algorithmic changes for even better results in the future.\n\nWhile there is no explicit table provided within the context shared above that can be reproduced here in HTML format, it's clear from the text that empirical benchmarking has been performed demonstrating FLASHATTENTION-2 achieving up to 73% of theoretical max throughput for forward pass and up to 63% for backward pass.\n\nIn conclusion, FLASHATTENTION-2 is a GPU-optimized attention mechanism that provides significantly faster performance compared to its predecessor, with potential applications in various types of data processing tasks such as understanding long texts or analyzing high-resolution images."}]}]
