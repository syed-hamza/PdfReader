It provides significant speedups for training GPT-style models, yielding up to 1.3\u00d7 faster training compared to its predecessor, FlashAttention, and up to 2.8\u00d7 faster than a standard baseline without FlashAttention. In benchmarking, FlashAttention-2 is reported to be approximately 2\u00d7 faster than FlashAttention and xformers implementation, and can be up to 10\u00d7 faster than standard attention implementations in PyTorch. It shows high utilization of model FLOPs, reaching 225 TFLOPs/s with 72% utilization per A100 GPU during training on models with 1.3B and 2.7B parameters."}]}]
