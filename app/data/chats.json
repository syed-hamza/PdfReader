The columns represent different evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and retrieval performance metrics such as recall and precision.\n\n**MonoTS**: This method achieves a moderate performance with 0.320 recall and 0.373 precision for the retrieval module.\n\n**Sides**: Sides performs better than MonoTS, with a higher recall (0.400) and precision (0.545).\n\n**Recomp**: Recomp is a re-ranking method that improves upon the initial retrieval results. Its performance is comparable to Sides, with 0.170 recall and 0.213 precision for the first iteration, increasing to 0.400 recall and 0.545 precision after re-ranking.\n\nThe LLM-Embedder method achieves high performance across various evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy (44.66), retrieval performance (70.20 recall and 84.48 precision), and other metrics such as 68.76 and 61.36. Adding Query Rewriting to the LLM-Embedder further improves its performance.\n\nThe results suggest that using a combination of methods, such as query rewriting and re-ranking, can lead to improved retrieval performance. Additionally, decomposing queries into subqueries (TOC) may also enhance retrieval results.\n\nFurther research is required to investigate:\n\n1. The impact of different query transformation techniques on retrieval performance.\n2. A detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each retrieval method.\n3. An analysis of how re-ranking methods like Recomp improve upon initial retrieval results."}]}]
